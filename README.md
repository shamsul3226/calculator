# 🐾 Ez Cat-culator

A sleek, responsive calculator that blends purr-sonality with precision. Built with **HTML**, **vanilla JavaScript**, and originally **vanilla CSS**, now proudly redesigned using **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI**.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML & Vanilla JS** – Core logic & DOM manipulation
- **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)** – Utility-first styling
- **DaisyUI (via CDN)** – Theme-friendly UI components

---

## ✨ Features

- Responsive layout with clean Tailwind styling
- Two theme backgrounds:
  - 🖤 `luxury` theme = Molly the cat
  - 🍋 `lemonade` theme = Nami the cat
- Display panel with soft opacity and blur for readability
- Calculator operations: basic math, special functions, keyboard support

---

## 🔍 What I Learned

This project was a sandbox for building UI and practicing frontend fundamentals. I explored:

- DOM manipulation & event handling
- Theme switching with Tailwind’s `data-[theme=value]` variants
- Using `bg-[url(...)]` for theme-based backgrounds
- Integrating Tailwind & DaisyUI using CDN (still mastering CLI setup!)

---

## 🚧 Upcoming Features

- 🔄 **Chain Calculation** — multiple operations in one input
- 📄 **Converter Pagination** — organized sub-features for unit conversion

---

## 🐛 Challenges & Notes

While using CDN makes setup faster, I'm actively learning to properly configure Tailwind & DaisyUI via CLI for long-term scalability. Errors still pop up—especially with JIT modes and image paths—but I'm working through it.
